## Included Features

### Docker

- Registry Support:
  - GitHub Container Registry (GHCR)
- Building for both amd64 and arm64 processors
- Entrypoint script set up to dynamically match UID and GID between host and container to solve permission issues with bind mounts on Linux hosts
- Automatic Semantic Versioning
- Automatic CI builds and pushes for whenever "src/\*\*" is changed on main branch
- Automatic release builds and pushes whenever [Release Please](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/release-please-action) pushes a new "v\*" tag
- Automatic attestation generation and publishing
- Dockerfile linting via [hadolint](https://github.com/hadolint/hadolint)

### Core

#### Support for Multiple CI/CD Platforms

- GitHub **Recommended**
  - Creating repos under both users and orgs is supported
  - See [GitHub Org Limitations](docs/github_org_limitations.md) for details about template features excluded for Orgs
- ~~Azure DevOps~~ _Azure DevOps support is not currently implemented for this template_
- ~~See [Azure DevOps Limitations](docs/azure_devops_limitations.md) for details about features missing for AzDO~~

#### Support for Public (Open-Source) and Private (Closed-Source) Repositories

This template fully supports both public/open-source and private/closed-source repositories. See [Public vs Private Repos](docs/public_vs_private_repos.md) for the difference.

#### Support for Existing Projects

Postmodern templates are designed to allow either the creation of new templates from scratch or adoption for existing projects with existing code repos.

#### Support for Template Updates

Keeping projects in sync with their parent template is a core feature of [Copier](https://github.com/copier-org/copier), and this template will deploy a GitHub Actions Workflow/Azure DevOps Pipeline that will automate the update process.

#### Support for Child/Recursive Templates

It is highly encouraged for you to take this template and make your own child template that meets your needs. Your child template can (optionally) receive updates from this template.
